At the moment the number of nodes is static.  
This will make it a little tricky to get multiple deployments (or Houses) out of one set of kit.

What I propose is to:
 + For each new deployment, create a new house.
 + Make sure the start and end dates are correct.
 + When Retrieving data, we limit by the house start and end date (or by user specified dates)
 
 [ ] I will also have to work out how this fits into node history



* BUGS
** Get the "Add new node page" to remember what I typed
** At the Moment the Deployment* Tables are not used,  It may be an Idea to set a page up to include these.
Rather than Deployment, it states house.  This may work in samson, but is not so good for what I need to do.
