** TODO Modify code to deal with updated values				:BUG:
   Reference Bug https://code.google.com/p/cogent-house/issues/detail?id=3
   
   This is related to the equality checking code. And modifying the details of the table after it is created.
   For Example consider the following deployments
   
   | DB     | id | name     | description                         | startDate | endDate |
   |--------+----+----------+-------------------------------------+-----------+---------|
   | Source |  1 | pushTest |                                     | 1/1/2013  |         |
   | Sink   |  1 | pushTest | A description added at a later date | 1/1/2013  |         | 

   They are the same deployment,  However the current method of checking if deployments match fails here. And a duplicate entry is created
   There is a similar problem for
   



** TODO Work out a sane way of uploading nodestates

* TODO Future work [0/1]
** TODO Better way of dealing with push node states.
   Currently We have a hacktastic (TM) method that looks at the most recent upload and fakes it based on that.
   It is possible that we could miss nodestates out of the transfer using this method.  
   However, it is a quick and simple  way that reduces network traffic.

* TODO Database Trickery [/]
** TODO Work out where Deployment fits into the grand scheme of things
** TODO Work out how to seperate samples
At the moment the number of nodes is static.  
This will make it a little tricky to get multiple deployments (or Houses) out of one set of kit.

What I propose is to:
 + For each new deployment, create a new house.
 + Make sure the start and end dates are correct.
 + When Retrieving data, we limit by the house start and end date (or by user specified dates)
 
 [ ] I will also have to work out how this fits into node history



* TODO BUGS [1/3]
** TODO Get the "Add new node page" to remember what I typed
** TODO At the Moment the Deployment* Tables are not used,  It may be an Idea to set a page up to include these.
Rather than Deployment, it states house.  This may work in samson, but is not so good for what I need to do.

** DONE Cannot register nodes on Deployment page..			:BUG:
