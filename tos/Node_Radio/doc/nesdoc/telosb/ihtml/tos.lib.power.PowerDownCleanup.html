    <h2>Interface: tos.lib.power.PowerDownCleanup</h2>
    <b>interface PowerDownCleanup</b><p>
 Please refer to TEP 115 for more information about this interface and its
 intended use.<br><br>

 This interface exists to allow a Resource user to cleanup any state
 information before a shared Resource is shutdown.  It should be provided
 by the user of a shared Resource, and used by the
 power managment component for that Resource.  The <code>cleanup()</code>
 command will be called by the power manager just before powering down
 the shared resource.
