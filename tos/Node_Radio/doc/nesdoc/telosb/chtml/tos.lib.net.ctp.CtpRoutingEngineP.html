    <p> 
  The TreeRoutingEngine is responsible for computing the routes for
  collection.  It builds a set of trees rooted at specific nodes (roots) and
  maintains these trees using information provided by the link estimator on
  the quality of one hop links.
 
  <p>Each node is part of only one tree at any given time, but there is no
  difference from the node's point of view of which tree it is part. In other
  words, a message is sent towards <i>a</i> root, but which one is not
  specified. It is assumed that the roots will work together to have all data
  aggregated later if need be.  The tree routing engine's responsibility is
  for each node to find the path with the least number of transmissions to
  any one root.

  <p>The tree is proactively maintained by periodic beacons sent by each
  node. These beacons are jittered in time to prevent synchronizations in the
  network. All nodes maintain the same <i>average</i> beacon sending rate
  (defined by BEACON_INTERVAL +- 50%). The beacon contains the node's parent,
  the current hopcount, and the cumulative path quality metric. The metric is
  defined as the parent's metric plus the bidirectional quality of the link
  between the current node and its parent.  The metric represents the
  expected number of transmissions along the path to the root, and is 0 by
  definition at the root.
 
  <p>Every time a node receives an update from a neighbor it records the
  information if the node is part of the neighbor table. The neighbor table
  keeps the best candidates for being parents i.e., the nodes with the best
  path metric. The neighbor table does not store the full path metric,
  though. It stores the parent's path metric, and the link quality to the
  parent is only added when the information is needed: (i) when choosing a
  parent and (ii) when choosing a route. The nodes in the neighbor table are
  a subset of the nodes in the link estimator table, as a node is not
  admitted in the neighbor table with an estimate of infinity.
 
  <p>There are two uses for the neighbor table, as mentioned above. The first
  one is to select a parent. The parent is just the neighbor with the best
  path metric. It serves to define the node's own path metric and hopcount,
  and the set of child-parent links is what defines the tree. In a sense the
  tree is defined to form a coherent propagation substrate for the path
  metrics. The parent is (re)-selected periodically, immediately before a
  node sends its own beacon, in the updateRouteTask.
  
  <p>The second use is to actually choose a next hop towards any root at
  message forwarding time.  This need not be the current parent, even though
  it is currently implemented as such.

  <p>The operation of the routing engine has two main tasks and one main
  event: updateRouteTask is called periodically and chooses a new parent;
  sendBeaconTask broadcasts the current route information to the neighbors.
  The main event is the receiving of a neighbor's beacon, which updates the
  neighbor table.
  
  <p> The interface with the ForwardingEngine occurs through the nextHop()
  call.
 
  <p> Any node can become a root, and routed messages from a subset of the
  network will be routed towards it. The RootControl interface allows
  setting, unsetting, and querying the root state of a node. By convention,
  when a node is root its hopcount and metric are 0, and the parent is
  itself. A root always has a valid route, to itself.
