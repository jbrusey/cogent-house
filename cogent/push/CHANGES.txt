Notes
======

Modified version of the push script that will fetch all items,
convert to JSON and (eventually) transfer across REST

This replaces the ssh tunnel database access currently used to transfer samples.

    .. note::

        I currently add 1 second to the time the last sample was transmitted,
        this means that there is no chance that the query to get readings will
        return an item that has all ready been synced, leading to an integrity
        error.

        I have tried lower values (0.5 seconds) but this pulls the last synced
        item out, this is possibly a error induced by mySQL's datetime not
        holding microseconds.


ChangeList 
===========

    .. since 0.1.0::

       Moved ssh port forwarding to paramiko (see sshclient class) This should
       stop the errors when there is a connection problem.

    .. since 0.1.1::

       * Better error handling
       * Pagination for sync results, transfer at most PUSH_LIMIT items at a
         time.

    .. since 0.1.2::

       Moved Nodestate Sync into the main readings sync class, this should stop
       duplicate nodestates turning up if there is a failure

    .. since 0.2.0::

       Overhaul of the system to make use of REST to upload samples rather than
       transfer data across directly.

    .. since 0.2.1::

       Make use of an .ini style config file to set everything up

       Split functionality into a Daemon, and Upload classes.  This should
       make maintenance of any local mappings a little easier to deal with.

   .. since 0.2.2::
       
       New Functionality to manually sync a database from scratch
       Some Changes to logging functionality

   .. since 0.3.0::
   
      Changed to upload readings by house.
      Modified initialisation to be a little more same
   
   .. since 0.3.1::
   
      Mapping configuration file added
      0.7.1  Update so logging also goes to file
      0.7.2  Bigfix for Null items in HouseId etc
   
   .. since 0.3.2::

      Some Code broken into seperate functions, to make interitance for the Samson Pusher class a little easier.
      Examples of this include Pusher.CreateEngine() and Pusher.Queue()

   .. since 0.3.3::
   
      Moved from rest_client to requests,  This should avoid the "broken pipe" error.

   .. since 0.3.4::
   
      Now use GZIP compression for bulk uploads
   

   .. since 0.3.5::

      General Code Tidyup,  Broke code into relevant modules


   .. since 0.3.6::

      Added a function to synchronise a nodes location Id with the sink independently
      Removed calls to depricated toDict() function

      Modified sync_nodes function:
          No longer pulls nodes from the remote server
	  Updates location Id's to the remote server
	  Updated test cases to reflect these changes
