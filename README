Database Branch
===================== 

Revision 88:ca885665aa56


Changes
===============

* I have moved the backrefs to the Parent class this allows two things to happen
   #. I can scan the code and see what classes have Children without having to M-X b
   #. as the parent *owns* the backref It allows the Referential Integrety code to happen without having to jump through hoops.

* Classes now have docstrings, Feel free to correct them if wrong


Things that need attention
===========================

* Reading.getCalibrated() is broken in this version (while it works under pyramid) for the moment it just returns the raw values

* Rework the Unittests to take account of how Rooms operate (ie we only ever have one Bathroom under rooms)

* We Still get a strange bug where one of the classes returns the wrong value (but only some of the time) I need to invesigate this.

Things that may break other code
==================================

A Couple of backrefs are called metadata, they have been renamed meta to stop any confusion between SQLA meta objects and class objects:

* Deployment / DeploymentMetadata (Rename deployment.meta to deployment.metadata
* House / HouseMetaData (Rename house.metas to house.meta)
